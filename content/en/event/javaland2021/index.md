summary: Collaborative remote work for developers
abstract: |
  Due to the curren Corona situation many team were forces to suddenly work together remotely.  
  The technical preconditions for it, like laptops, VPN, etc., where mostly quickly (if not already) available. 
  But how about tooling for collaborative remote work: communication within a team, pair-programming or even mob-programming?

  In this talk I want to show you some of the tools we use in our daily remote working setup. And I want to talk about the pros and cons of them and what elso to consider when working remotely together.
