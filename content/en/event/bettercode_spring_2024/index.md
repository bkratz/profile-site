abstract: |
  When people talk about SpringBoot they often mention, that there is a lot of "Magic" happening.
  You ad a dependency and - presto - something is happening. But what exactly?
  We will have a peek behind the magic curtains.

  We will find out about "Autoconfiguration".
  We will find out what it is and how it works an how to configure it to your own needs.
  And we will find out, how you can write your own autoconfiguration.
