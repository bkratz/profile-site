summary: A (Unit-)Test-Antipattern-Fairytale
abstract: |
  Once upon a time there was a test set forth to become a beautiful test.
  Its parents warned it to be careful about Giants, Liars, Slow Pokes and all sorts of other villains which would cross its way.
  Another warning was to never cross the borders of the country.
  
  We will accompany this test on its way.
  We will help to identify and stay clear of the villains.
  
  At the end of its way it will meet many other test, which have been careful as well.
  And together they will live happily ever after...
