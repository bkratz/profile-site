summary: Contract-first development with OpenAPI
abstract: |
  When we are talking about developing a REST-API, there are mainly two ways to do that: contract-first or code-first.

  In this talk I want to concentrate on the contract-first approach with the help of the OpenAPI  specification.
  What is OpenAPI?  
  How do I define contracts with it?  
  Which tools are available?  
  And how do I generate code out of it?  
  I will talk about the experiences I made using this approach and will show, what the advantages and disadvantages are.
