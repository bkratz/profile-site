summary: Oh no!! Why it is sometimes good, if a test fails.
abstract: |
  Test coverage: 100% - Check!  
  And why do we still have bugs?  
  OK, tests don't prove the absence of errors.  
  And at the end of the day, they are just code which could contain bugs as well.  
  And perhaps they give us a false sense of security.  
  But how do I know, that my test are good?  

  One way to find out is using Mutation Testing.  
  In this talk I want to explain, what Mutation Testing is, how to do it and when it is helpful.
