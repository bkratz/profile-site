I'm a freelance software developer, enthusiastic about using agile methods, writing clean-code and practicing test driven development (TDD).
I have more then 20 years of experience of project work in several sectors and all team sizes.
My focus currently is developing RESTful Web-Services with Java and SpringBoot, including all aspects like architecture, development, quality assurance and testing.

I'm an organizor of the [Softwerkskammer](https://softwerkskammer.org) meetings in [Cologne](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Softwerkskammer-Koln/) and [DÃ¼sseldorf](https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Softwerkskammer-Dusseldorf/).
